# XylophoneApp
A real-time physical model of a Xylophone in JUCE

This JUCE application presents the simulation of a xylophone. The physical model is realised by using a one-dimensional finite difference scheme of an ideal bar.

Usage: on clicking anywhere on the application screen, the physical model is excited by a raised cosine.
